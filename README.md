# An api built on a WordPress theme

This is a wordpress theme that outputs json data instead of HTML. If you ask yourself why? just think about throwing in a blender the permalink capabilities of WordPress, plus the caching plugins available plus a JSON/JSONP output and you'll have your answer

## Installation

- Upload to your wp-content/themes folder 
- Activate at the WordPress admin dashboard of your site

## Usage

- Just follow the permalink structure you have chosen for your wordpress site in order to get the json data from the posts.
